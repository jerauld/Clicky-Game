# Clicky Game: Imperial Helmet Edition

**Overview**

Clicky Game: Imperial Helmet Edition was created for the Clicky Game homework assignment for Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. Clicky Game: Imperial Helmet Edition is a memory game built with React. The assignment requires that application's UI be broken up into components, component state management, and user event responses.

**Deployment Requirements**

This app was created using `create-react-app <app-name>` command which requires `npm i create-react-app` and `npm i yarn`. Therefore the only changes were as follows

* `/src`
* `/public/images` containing the imperial-helemet images and Captain-Phasma background image.
* `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ropa+Sans" rel="stylesheet">` was added to the `/public/index.html` header.

`yarn start` in the root folder to run locally via `localhost: 3000`
